Constitution Web App

Notes:

- Nick
  - Set up formatting of constitution using article, section, h2, h3, and p tags
  - Divied up articles/amendments to team members so we could quickly convert the entire text of the Constitution into formatted HTML
  - Used JS and CSS to allow for toggling articles or sections by clicking their headers
    - took inspiration from a previous personal project of mine
    - https://github.com/NicholasCiuica/RPS2D
- Carli
  - Added Article IV and Amendments 11-27
  - Formatted individual sections of added amendments with paragraphs as shown in Constitution
